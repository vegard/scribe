...but since these are copyrighted, they have as of September 13, 2008 been
replaced with the "Scribe" sprites, found here:

These are also copyrighted, but we have permission to use and distribute
them by the Creative Commons license.

Requires the OpenGL, GLU, GLUT, and PNG libraries.
To compile, run `make'. To play, run `./scribe'.

Press F12 to save a screenshot to the png directory.

If you want to make a "screencast" (a movie), you can add -DCONFIG_CAPTURE to
CFLAGS and recompile the program. This will save 1 new PNG file for each
frame that is displayed on the screen. These can later be combined into for
example an Ogg Theora movie using this command:

    $ png2theora -o screencast.ogv png/%04d.png
