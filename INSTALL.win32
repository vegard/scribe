I don't use Windows myself, but it is possible to compile Scribe for Windows
using Wine (winehq) to run the Dev-C++ compiler.

You will need to download and install these Devpaks:

glut: http://old.devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=128
zlib: http://devpaks.org/details.php?devpak=27
libpng: http://devpaks.org/details.php?devpak=28

Be sure to create a Win32 GUI C++ project. You will have to add these linker
flags (in this particular order) as well:

-lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lpng -lz -lwinmm
